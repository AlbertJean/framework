<h1>About</h1>
Grannies-Games came about years ago, when two semi youngish students
were thinking of making games and get rich fast(tm). However, due to
various circumstances, a company was never started. The two, grew
older, graduated, went their seperate ways, found jobs and new
educations and for a long time, nothing happened. While one of the two
went to game design school, the other found a job in IT. A full year
passed and the IT development guy found himself thinking back to the days filled
with dreams of making games. Then, when the other dude suddenly
suggested to start an iPhone development company together, the path
was clear.
Grannies-Games was born and development of their first protoype would
begin shortly.
