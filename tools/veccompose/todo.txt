veccompose
--------------------

- manage shape library
- import vector shapes
- reload shape library
- split vector shapes by group
- angle: textbox
- behaviour flags (per link)
	- turret type
	- rotation mode (target player, target player/instant, random, none)
- global behaviour
	- thruster behaviour
	- thruster speed
	- agressiveness
- move groups by their pivots (?)
- save
	- link graph
- load
	- link graph

content tools
--------------------

- parse boss description
- load vector shapes
- generate optimized data structures
- write binary

--------------------
content build process
--------------------

- incorporate boss descriptions

engine
--------------------

- boss rendering
	- bosses too large to be drawn as vector shapes
	  (texture atlas limitations)
		- draw filled triangles
		- draw outline
- boss hebaviour
	- movement
	- targeting
	- firing
	- damage infliction
	- destruction (including sub segments)
- boss animation
	- destruction sequence
- boss collision detection
	- selection buffer too slow
		- use optimized collision detection for bullets (point hit test)
		- pre-transform vertices (requires extra data per segment)
		- limit max # collision triangles to 5 per shape (no dynamic alloc shadow copy)
		- speedup:
			- use world grid (?)
			- reduced CD frequency (10..20 Hz) (?)
			- collision sphere per segment (rotation invariant) (?)
			- don't bother with trees - too much overhead

non-veccompose stuff
--------------------
- slowly targeting vulcans on boss
- missiles follow target for limited amount of time, then resume linearly
- missile trail to create a missile like effect (primary smoke, fades quickly, gray, secondary smoke, orange, fades slowly)
- fix ship allocation pool issue
- make min spread a little wider
- use water effect on background, distort texture coordinates, lookup old integer water code
	- update at 10 Hz, animate at 60
- sparkle effect health/energy bar on invincibility powerup, bar -> blue
- controller: texture overlay
